# exo1 - Practice on deep copy and shallow copy

[Difference between Shallow and Deep copy](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-shallow-and-deep-copy-of-a-class/#:~:text=Deep%20copy%20stores%20copies%20of,the%20references%20to%20the%20objects.)

Key Points :

Shallow copy

- quicker as it is easy
- simply copies over the pointer price
- store reference to the original object
- reflect changes made on the new/copy object in the original object

Deep copy:

- slower
- clones the underlying data
- does not reflect changes on the original object as it has no reference to it
